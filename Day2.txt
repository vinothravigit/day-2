window Object:

The window object represents the global browser window or tab.
It serves as the global object in client-side JavaScript, providing a global scope for variables and functions.
Properties and methods associated with the window object relate to the browser environment, such as window.innerWidth, window.location, and window.alert().
It encompasses the entire browsing context and includes features like navigation, history, and the ability to open new windows or frames.

document Object:

The document object represents the HTML document loaded in the browser window or tab.
It is a property of the window object and can be accessed globally in client-side JavaScript.
Properties and methods associated with the document object relate to the content and structure of the HTML document, such as document.getElementById(), d
ocument.createElement(), and document.title.It allows interaction with the content of the web page, including manipulation of HTML elements, handling events, 
and modifying the document structure. In summary, the window object represents the entire browser window and provides global features, while the document object
 is a part of the window object and specifically represents the HTML document, enabling interaction and manipulation of the document's structure and content. 
Understanding the distinction between these two objects is essential for effective client-side web development.
